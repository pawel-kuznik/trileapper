# Project

This project is an experiment to create a 3 column design with JS and CSS that works
dynamically and adjusts to a wide (desktop/laptop) screen and to a mobile device.
This project is a fruit of conversation with another developer that claimed using
"gestures" for mobile with such layout is impossible cause Android operating system
doesn't support move left and move right gestures. I can't believe it.
